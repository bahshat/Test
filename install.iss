Great to hear your Inno Setup installer is working! Letâ€™s address your questions on size optimization, finish button issue, and distribution strategy.

âœ… 1. Can we avoid copying the frontend folder to Program Files?

Yes â€” you donâ€™t need to copy the entire frontend/ folder to Program Files if itâ€™s only used to install the .msixbundle via Add-AppDevPackage.ps1.

âœ… Recommended:
	â€¢	Instead of copying frontend/, run the install script directly from the setup source folder.
	â€¢	You can mark the folder as dontcopy using a flag in the [Files] section:

[Files]
Source: "installer_setup\frontend\*"; DestDir: "{tmp}\frontend"; Flags: deleteafterinstall

Or use {src} if youâ€™re sure installer can run scripts from source:

[Run]
Filename: "powershell.exe"; Parameters: "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ""{tmp}\frontend\Add-AppDevPackage.ps1"""; Flags: runhidden

This way, it installs and deletes the temporary files, keeping final installed size small.

âœ… 2. Finish button not showing in wizard

Youâ€™re right: this typically happens if:
	â€¢	A long-running process (like Add-AppDevPackage.ps1) runs without letting Inno Setup know it has finished.
	â€¢	Or the run step is not asynchronous-safe.

âœ… Fix:

Use WaitUntilTerminated=yes to ensure the script completes before finishing UI:

[Run]
Filename: "powershell.exe"; Parameters: "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ""{tmp}\frontend\Add-AppDevPackage.ps1"""; Flags: runhidden; WaitUntilTerminated=yes

And ensure the script doesnâ€™t leave child processes running (like msiexec or PowerShell background tasks).

âœ… 3. Other Size Optimizations

Area	Optimization
.msixbundle	Remove debug symbols (sign only release)
frontend/	Donâ€™t copy, use deleteafterinstall
backend/	Zip it beforehand and extract via script
Compress level	Set Compression=lzma2/ultra64
Icons/images	Use .ico instead of .png/.bmp

In [Setup]:

Compression=lzma2/ultra64
SolidCompression=yes

âœ… 4. Better Way to Share the Installer

Option	Description
ðŸ”¹ Azure DevOps Artifact	Upload final .exe or .zip automatically after build
ðŸ”¹ Share via OneDrive/Google Drive	Easy, but less professional
ðŸ”¹ Self-hosted page	Simple HTML page with changelog + download
ðŸ”¹ GitHub Release	Great for public or open projects

âœ… Bonus: Add Versioning + Metadata

[Setup]
AppVersion={#MyAppVersion}
AppPublisher=Your Company
AppPublisherURL=https://example.com
AppSupportURL=https://example.com/support

Keep version in a separate .iss include file or pass as CLI arg.

Let me know if youâ€™d like:
	â€¢	RunOnce logic for backend startup
	â€¢	Script to zip/unzip backend cleanly during install
	â€¢	Cleanup mechanism to auto-remove install folders

Youâ€™re doing great â€” just a bit more polishing now ðŸš€
