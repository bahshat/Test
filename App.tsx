Excellent progress — you’re almost there. The backend launching issue you’re facing is a classic case:

❗ Problem:

When you launch Backend.exe via .bat, it opens child cmd windows that immediately disappear. But when run manually, it works fine.

✅ Why This Happens

When you use:

start "" /b /min "Backend.exe"

It launches the .exe without a proper console environment, or the process exits too fast due to lack of blocking or detached setup.

✅ Solution: Use start without /b and allow detached console

🔧 Try This First:

start "" "C:\Path\To\Backend.exe"

Let it open its own window. Do not use /b or /min for now.

If that works, then we’ll clean it up.

✅ Option 2: Launch via PowerShell with Start-Process -NoNewWindow

More stable control:

powershell -Command "Start-Process 'C:\Path\To\Backend.exe' -WindowStyle Hidden"

Or visible:

powershell -Command "Start-Process 'C:\Path\To\Backend.exe'"

✅ This ensures the process is launched fully detached and not killed instantly.

✅ Option 3: If It’s a Batch File/Script Inside .exe

Sometimes, .exe wraps a script or toolchain that spawns children and exits — in this case:
	•	Use cmd /k or cmd /c carefully:

cmd /k "Backend.exe"

	•	/k keeps the window open (good for debugging)
	•	/c runs and exits (not what you want)

✅ Recommendation: Stable + Hidden Launch

If all works when launched manually, then use:

powershell -Command "Start-Process 'C:\Path\To\Backend.exe' -WindowStyle Hidden"

	If needed: create a .vbs script to fully hide even the flashing window.

✅ Final Tip: Log Output for Debugging

If still unsure, capture logs:

start "" cmd /k "Backend.exe >> backend_log.txt 2>&1"

This will show what’s going wrong by logging backend’s console.

Let me know what the backend is actually doing (is it Python with Flask under the hood?), and I can suggest a better launcher if needed.
