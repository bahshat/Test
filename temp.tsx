Yes — we can absolutely debug this. When your installed RNW app isn’t hitting the Flask API, it’s usually due to network restrictions, localhost confusion, or packaging permissions.

Let’s fix it step-by-step.

✅ Step-by-Step Debugging

1. Confirm: Is Flask Running and Listening?

Run your Flask app manually and confirm:

 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

If it says 127.0.0.1 and your app is trying to hit localhost, that’s fine — but if the frontend is using localhost and you later package the app, it may resolve differently.

2. Use Full IP Instead of localhost or 127.0.0.1

Edit your Flask app.run() to listen on all interfaces:

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

And in your React Native Windows Constants.ts, update:

export const BASE_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000'; // or use your local IP like http://192.168.1.x:5000

Make sure it’s not localhost if app is installed via MSIX — due to UWP containerization, localhost might behave differently.

3. Temporarily Log Inside RNW App

In the network call (inside Network.ts):

console.log("Calling API at: ", BASE_URL);
try {
  const res = await fetch(BASE_URL + "/suites");
  console.log("Response received");
} catch (err) {
  console.error("API call failed:", err);
}

Then open the app and press:

Ctrl + Shift + I

You’ll get React DevTools + Console. Check the logs.

4. Enable Loopback (Required for MSIX apps)

Critical for localhost access in packaged apps

Run this in PowerShell (Admin):

CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n="Ochoa_123abcxyz" 

	Replace "Ochoa_123abcxyz" with your actual package family name. You can find it using:

Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*Ochoa*" } | Select PackageFamilyName

5. Test API from PowerShell

Check if Windows can hit the Flask API at all:

curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/suites

If this fails, Flask isn’t running or listening on correct IP.

✅ Summary

Step	Goal
Host = 0.0.0.0	Ensure Flask accepts external connections
BASE_URL = IP	Avoid localhost quirks in MSIX
Dev console in RNW	See live errors
Loopback exempt	Allow MSIX to hit local server

Would you like me to create a NetworkChecker.ts module to test connectivity and show alerts if Flask is unreachable?
