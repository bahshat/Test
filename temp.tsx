To launch your React Native Windows app (packaged as .msix or .msixbundle) as an administrator, here‚Äôs what you need to know:

‚ùó Important Limitation

	üü• MSIX-installed apps cannot be run as administrator.

This is by Windows design:
	‚Ä¢	MSIX apps are sandboxed
	‚Ä¢	They always run with user-level permissions
	‚Ä¢	Right-click ‚Üí ‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù is not available
	‚Ä¢	Even if you launch the app from PowerShell as Admin ‚Äî it won‚Äôt elevate

‚úÖ What Can You Do Instead?

‚úÖ Option 1: Launch the Raw .exe as Admin

If you built the app using Visual Studio or have a loose .exe build (not MSIX):

Start-Process "C:\path\to\Ochoa.exe" -Verb RunAs

This will run the app as full administrator.

‚úÖ Option 2: Use CheckNetIsolation to Enable Localhost Access

Instead of running as admin, just give loopback permission:

CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n="YourApp_PackageFamilyName"

	Find your package family name with:

Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*Ochoa*" } | Select PackageFamilyName

This is the recommended solution for MSIX apps needing to talk to localhost.

‚úÖ Option 3: Switch to LAN IP in Fetch Calls

Instead of http://127.0.0.1:5000, use your real IP:

export const BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.0.101:5000';

And launch Flask with:

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

This way, sandboxing isn‚Äôt a problem, even without admin rights.

‚úÖ Summary

Action	Works?	Notes
Run .msix app as admin	‚ùå	Not supported by Windows
Run raw .exe as admin	‚úÖ	Use Start-Process -Verb RunAs
Enable loopback for MSIX	‚úÖ	Use CheckNetIsolation
Use real IP instead of localhost	‚úÖ	Works even without loopback permission
