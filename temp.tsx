Thanks for confirming. Since you’ve followed all proper steps (correct certificate, signing tool, no timestamp, rebuilt .msix) and SignerSign() is still failing, here’s what we will do now:

✅ Alternative Solution: Distribute Without Signing

Since your use case is internal/testing:

1. Use App Installer PowerShell Script Only

Skip .msix signing — just install the app using:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
Add-AppxPackage -ForceApplicationShutdown "C:\path\to\your\App.msix"

This works if:
	•	The device has sideloading enabled
(Settings > For Developers > Install apps from any source)
	•	The .msix doesn’t require store-level signing

✅ Fallback Plan: Use Portable Executable

You can also package the RNW app as a portable .exe that:
	•	Doesn’t use .msix
	•	Just launches your React Native Windows app via script

Let me know if you’d prefer this — I can help create:
	•	A bundled .zip with:
	•	Backend .exe
	•	RNW app starter .bat
	•	Config check

No signing or installation needed — just extract and run.

✅ Recommendation

For dev/demo sharing, this “portable zip + launcher” method is safest and avoids all signtool issues.

Would you like me to help you prepare that now?
