You’re exactly right to ask this—let me break it down clearly:

✅ Summary

If the IT team allowlists your certificate, but does not install it into the user’s machine (i.e. not adding to the Trusted Root / Trusted People), then:

	❌ Your signed .msix or .exe will still not install without a warning or may even fail, especially on systems without Developer Mode enabled.

🔒 1. What Does “Allowlisting Certificate” Mean?

There are 2 possibilities:

A. ✅ They install (import) the certificate on every machine

	📌 This is what you need.
They add your .cer to:

	•	Trusted People (if it’s self-signed and locally trusted)
	•	or Trusted Root Certification Authorities (for root CA certs)

B. ❌ They just approve your cert internally (but don’t install it)

	✅ This might help with firewall or internal network checks
❌ But it does not help with installation – because Windows checks certificate trust at local machine level

🔧 2. What’s Needed to Make It Work Seamlessly?

For your signed .msix or .exe to install without issues, the user system must:
	•	Have your certificate installed in Local Machine > Trusted People
	•	OR have Developer Mode enabled (not recommended for production)
	•	OR use Enterprise-signed certificates that chain to a trusted CA

✅ 3. How IT Can Add Cert to All Machines

They can do this via:

📍 A. Manually install the .cer file:
	1.	Right-click .cer file → Install Certificate
	2.	Choose:
	•	“Local Machine”
	•	Place in: Trusted People

🖥️ B. Use PowerShell (Silent, Scripting)

Import-Certificate -FilePath "C:\Path\to\yourcert.cer" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople

	🔐 Run as Administrator

🏢 C. Use Group Policy (GPO) for Org-wide Distribution

IT can add your cert across all devices via Group Policy:
	1.	Group Policy Editor > Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Public Key Policies > Trusted People
	2.	Import your cert
	3.	It applies across the organization

🛑 What If Cert Isn’t Added?

If they only allowlist it in firewall rules or backend tooling:
	•	The installer will still show “Unknown Publisher”
	•	It may even fail to install on .msix since Windows enforces cert trust
	•	Even signed .exe or .bat will show UAC and “Do you want to allow this from Unknown Publisher?”

✅ Final Recommendation

Tell the IT team:

	“Allowlisting the certificate is good, but unless it’s imported into Trusted People on the client machine, the app will still show unsigned or even block installation. Please either push the cert using GPO or give us a script to install the certificate silently during setup.”

Let me know if you’d like a .ps1 script for silently installing your cert into TrustedPeople, or for packaging it into your installer.
