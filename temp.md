Yes, you can sign your Python .exe and even your Inno Setup-generated installer .exe using the same certificate that Visual Studio used for signing the frontend React Native Windows app. Below is everything you need to know:

✅ Summary: What You Want to Do
	1.	🔐 Use the same certificate (generated by VS) to sign:
	•	Your Python backend .exe
	•	Your Inno Setup-generated installer .exe
	2.	✅ Use signtool.exe – the standard Microsoft tool for code signing
	3.	🗂 Need a .pfx file (not just .cer) – this contains private key

🔍 1. Does .cer Work?

No – .cer only contains the public key.

To digitally sign files, you need:
	•	.pfx (Personal Information Exchange) file
	•	It includes both private and public keys

	So yes, you must use .pfx, not just .cer.

📍 2. Where is the .pfx file?

If you used Visual Studio to generate the certificate:
	•	You can find the .pfx in this path:

<solution root>\Ochoa.Package\Ochoa.Package_TemporaryKey.pfx

Or under:

<solution root>\Ochoa.Package\AppPackages\<YourAppName>_Test\...



	Search for *.pfx inside your Ochoa.Package folder.

🛠️ 3. How to Sign .exe with signtool

✅ Prerequisites
	•	Open Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio (with admin)
	•	Or use PowerShell with environment path to signtool.exe

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\<version>\x64\signtool.exe"

✅ Command to Sign Python .exe or Setup .exe

signtool sign /f "C:\Path\To\YourCert.pfx" /p <your_password> /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 /fd sha256 "C:\Path\To\your-backend.exe"

Replace:
	•	/f: path to .pfx
	•	/p: certificate password
	•	/tr: timestamp server
	•	/td and /fd: digest algorithm
	•	Final argument is the path to .exe

💡 To sign the Inno Setup .exe after it’s built:

signtool sign /f "your-cert.pfx" /p <password> /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 /fd sha256 "output\MyInstaller.exe"

You can automate this in the [Code] or [Run] section in .iss file too, or sign the installer after build in your CI pipeline.

🛡️ 4. Benefits of Signing Backend and Installer
	•	Avoid “Unknown publisher” warnings
	•	Trusted by Windows SmartScreen
	•	Users won’t need to override security prompts
	•	Keeps same signature identity across all parts of the app

🧪 Optional: Convert .cer + private key → .pfx

If you only have a .cer and a private key file:

openssl pkcs12 -export -out your-cert.pfx -inkey your-private.key -in your-cert.cer

✅ Recap

Task	Required File	Tool	Notes
Sign backend .exe	.pfx	signtool	Must include private key
Sign Inno Setup .exe	.pfx	signtool	Improves installer trust
Location of cert	Ochoa.Package dir		Look for .pfx, not just .cer
Use .cer only?	❌ No		Doesn’t include private key

Let me know if you want me to:
	•	Write a PowerShell/Batch to automate signing
	•	Integrate signing into Inno Setup
	•	Help you locate and verify your .pfx file
